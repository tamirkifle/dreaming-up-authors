# Dreaming Up Authors: Factual Prevalence and LLM Hallucinations in Academic Authorship Attribution

Code for the EMNLP 2026 paper *Dreaming Up Authors: Factual Prevalence and LLM Hallucinations in Academic Authorship Attribution*.

The paper asks whether LLMs hallucinate more when they attribute authors to papers that are rarely cited (i.e. less prevalent in their training data). This repository covers:

| Folder | What it does | Paper |
|---|---|---|
| [`01_data_collection/`](01_data_collection) | Samples papers from the Open Academic Graph, builds the 9,108-paper evaluation set and the 6,048-paper prevalence-proxy set | Section 2, Section 4.1, Appendix "Dataset Details" and "Data Sampling Strategy" |
| [`02_google_search_hits/`](02_google_search_hits) | Google search hit counts vs. citation count | Section 3.1, Figure 2 (left), Appendix "Google Search Hits Analysis" |
| [`03_llm_corpus_occurrence/`](03_llm_corpus_occurrence) | Infini-gram n-gram counts in open pretraining corpora (OLMo2-32B, RedPajama) vs. citation count | Section 3.2, Figure 2 (right), Appendix "LLM Corpus Occurrence Analysis" |
| [`04_gpt4o_recall_llm_selfeval/`](04_gpt4o_recall_llm_selfeval) | Open-ended authorship attribution with GPT-4o, scored by LLM self-evaluation | Appendix "Evaluation Method Comparison"; input to module 05 |
| [`05_mc_recognition/`](05_mc_recognition) | Multiple-choice recognition experiment (recall vs. recognition) with three distractor constructions | Section 6, Appendix "More Details on Multiple-choice Recognition Analysis" |

> **Main results.** The main hallucination-rate results (hard-coded evaluation; GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1 and Claude Sonnet 4.5), the Semantic Scholar matching and quality filtering, and the hidden-state analyses are in **[PLACEHOLDER: link to the co-author's code / folder]**. Module 04 here is the GPT-4o run with LLM self-evaluation; it is used for the evaluation-method comparison and as the recall baseline of the MC experiment.

## 1. Environment setup

Requirements: Python 3.10 or newer.

```bash
git clone <this repository>
cd dreaming-up-authors

python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate          # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

cp .env.example .env               # then fill in the keys you need
```

### Credentials (`.env`)

Only the keys for the modules you run are needed. `.env` is git-ignored; never commit it.

| Variable | Needed for | Where to get it |
|---|---|---|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | modules 04 and 05 | <https://platform.openai.com/api-keys> |
| `BRIGHTDATA_API_KEY`, `BRIGHTDATA_ZONE` | module 02 | a BrightData account with a SERP API zone |
| `S2_API_KEY` (optional) | `01/07_fetch_datasets_from_ids.py`, `05/fetch_collaborators.py` | <https://www.semanticscholar.org/product/api>; without a key the shared rate limit (~1 request/s) is used |

The Infini-gram API (module 03) needs no key.

### Data locations

All paths are defined in [`config.py`](config.py). By default, intermediate data is written to `./data/` and results to `./results/` (both git-ignored). The raw data needs about 100 GB, so you can move it to another disk (e.g. an external drive) by setting these variables in `.env`:

| Variable | Default | Content |
|---|---|---|
| `DATA_DIR` | `./data` | all intermediate datasets |
| `RESULTS_DIR` | `./results` | API outputs, tables, figures |
| `OAG_RAW_DIR` | `$DATA_DIR/raw/oag_v2` | extracted OAG v2 files `mag_papers_0.txt` ... `mag_papers_10.txt` |
| `MATCHED_NDJSON` | `$DATA_DIR/semantic_scholar_matched/matched_filtered.ndjson` | output of the Semantic Scholar matching + filtering step |

### How to run

* **Scripts** (`.py`) are run from the repository root, e.g. `python 01_data_collection/05_sample_eval_set.py`. Every script prints its usage with `--help` (or in its docstring).
* **Notebooks** (`.ipynb`) are run from their own folder, e.g. `cd 02_google_search_hits && jupyter notebook analysis_google_hits.ipynb`.

## 2. Pipeline overview

```
OAG v2 (MAG papers, ~100 GB)
  └─ 01/01_sample_oag_papers.py ........... 10M random papers
       └─ [Semantic Scholar matching + 5 quality filters: co-author's code, see PLACEHOLDER]
            └─ matched NDJSON
                 └─ 01/03_flatten_matched_records.py ... CSV chunks
                      ├─ 01/05_sample_eval_set.py ....... 9,108-paper evaluation set ─┬─ 04 GPT-4o recall (self-evaluation)
                      │                                                                  └─ 05 MC recognition (uses 04)
                      └─ 01/04_build_query_fields.py
                           └─ 01/06_sample_proxy_set.py . 6,048-paper proxy set ─┬─ 02 Google search hits
                                                                                  └─ 03 Infini-gram counts ── Figure 2

Shortcut: 01/07_fetch_datasets_from_ids.py rebuilds both sets from the released ID files.
```

**Shortcut: skip the raw data.** You do not need the raw OAG data to rerun modules 02-05 on exactly the same papers as the paper. Three small ID files in `01_data_collection/` list the papers with their citation count and citation bin from the September 2025 snapshot; the evaluation-set file also stores the field and the ground-truth author list (`authors-info`: author names and Semantic Scholar author IDs):

| File | Papers | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `paper_ids_9108.csv` | evaluation set (`paperId, citationCount, citation_bin, field, authors-info`) | modules 04, 05 |
| `paper_ids_6048.csv` | prevalence-proxy set (`paperId, citationCount, citation_bin`) | modules 02, 03 |
| `paper_ids_6048_resample.csv` | independent proxy resample (6,047 papers) | module 03 robustness check |

```bash
python 01_data_collection/07_fetch_datasets_from_ids.py --set all
```

This fetches the remaining metadata (titles and years; author lists for the proxy sets) from the Semantic Scholar API and writes `eval_set_9108.csv`, `proxy_set_6048.csv` and `proxy_set_6048_resample.csv` in the same format as steps 5 and 6 (see [Section 8](#8-reproducibility-notes) for caveats).

---

## 3. Module 01: data collection

Folder: [`01_data_collection/`](01_data_collection)

### Step 0: download the raw data

Download the MAG paper files of **Open Academic Graph v2** (`mag_papers_0.zip`, `mag_papers_1.zip`, `mag_papers_2.zip`) from the OAG website (<https://www.aminer.cn/oag-2-1>, or the Microsoft Research Open Academic Graph page), and extract them into `OAG_RAW_DIR`. You should get `mag_papers_0.txt` ... `mag_papers_10.txt` (JSON lines, one paper per line).

### Steps

| Step | Command | Output | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `python 01_data_collection/01_sample_oag_papers.py` | `data/oag_sample/sampled_mag_papers_all_fields_chunk_{0..9}.csv` | 10 rounds of reservoir sampling (1M papers each, disjoint, seed 1234). Reads the full dump 10 times, so it takes many hours. |
| 2 | `python 01_data_collection/02_check_duplicates.py` | (printout) | Confirms that the 10M sampled papers are unique. |
| - | *Semantic Scholar matching + quality filtering* | `MATCHED_NDJSON` | **Not part of this folder:** [PLACEHOLDER: link to the co-author's code]. It keeps journal/conference papers with 1-20 authors and English titles (fastText), removes malformed author names, matches the papers to Semantic Scholar (up-to-date citation counts, author names, fields of study) and keeps only exact title / first-author matches (Appendix, "Details of Data Filtering"). Each output line holds the OAG fields under `original.*` and the Semantic Scholar record under `semantic_scholar.*`. |
| 3 | `python 01_data_collection/03_flatten_matched_records.py` | `data/matched_chunks/chunk_{i}.csv` | Flattens the NDJSON into CSV chunks of 10,000 papers. |
| 4 | `python 01_data_collection/04_build_query_fields.py` | `data/query_fields/samples_google_search_{i}.csv` | Author-name lists, last names, and the Google query `"title" "author 1" "author 2" ...`. |
| 5 | `python 01_data_collection/05_sample_eval_set.py` | `data/eval_set/eval_set_9108.csv` (+ `_all_columns.csv`) | Stratified evaluation set: 8 fields x 13 citation bins, up to 100 papers per stratum; 9,108 papers. |
| 6 | `python 01_data_collection/06_sample_proxy_set.py` | `data/proxy_set/proxy_set_6048.csv` | Up to 500 papers per citation bin (6,048 papers) for modules 02 and 03. |
| 6b | `python 01_data_collection/06_sample_proxy_set.py --resample` | `data/proxy_set/proxy_set_6048_resample.csv` | Independent second sample (chunks scanned in reverse order) for the Infini-gram robustness check. |
| 7 | `python 01_data_collection/07_fetch_datasets_from_ids.py --set all` | `data/eval_set/eval_set_9108.csv`, `data/proxy_set/proxy_set_6048.csv`, `data/proxy_set/proxy_set_6048_resample.csv` | **Alternative to steps 1-6**: rebuilds the exact paper sets of the paper from the released ID files `paper_ids_*.csv`. |

**Citation bins** (13, exponentially spaced): 0-2, 3-4, 5-8, 9-16, 17-32, 33-64, 65-128, 129-256, 257-512, 513-1024, 1025-2048, 2049-4096, 4097+.
**Fields** (8): medicine, biology, chemistry, computer science, psychology, physics, materials science, mathematics. A paper's field is the first of its Semantic Scholar `fieldsOfStudy` that is one of these eight.

Columns of `eval_set_9108.csv`: `paperId, title, year, authors-info, citationCount, citation_bin, field, full_name_list`.

---

## 4. Module 02: Google search hits

Folder: [`02_google_search_hits/`](02_google_search_hits). Input: `data/proxy_set/proxy_set_6048.csv`.

1. **Crawl** (paid BrightData SERP API, one request per paper):
   ```bash
   python 02_google_search_hits/crawl_google_hits.py
   ```
   Results are saved in batches of 500 papers under `results/google_search_hits/crawl_batches/`, so an interrupted crawl resumes where it stopped; all batches are then merged into `results/google_search_hits/combined_google_results.csv`. Failed queries are skipped (5,179 of 6,048 papers returned a hit count in the paper).
2. **Analyse**: run `02_google_search_hits/analysis_google_hits.ipynb`.

**Results** (in `results/google_search_hits/`):

| File | Paper |
|---|---|
| `citation_bucket_stats_full.csv` | hit-count statistics per bucket on all crawled papers (N = 5,179) and the average query length per bucket |
| `citation_bucket_stats_80.csv` | after removing hits above the 80th percentile per bucket (N = 4,185); Figure 2 (left) |
| `citation_bucket_stats_{75,90,95}.csv` | other cutoffs (sensitivity check) |
| `citation_vs_google_hits.pdf` | log2-scale scatter plot with a linear fit |

Hit counts come from a live search engine, so a new crawl will give different absolute numbers, but the increasing trend with citation count should hold.

---

## 5. Module 03: LLM corpus occurrence (Infini-gram)

Folder: [`03_llm_corpus_occurrence/`](03_llm_corpus_occurrence). Input: `data/proxy_set/proxy_set_6048.csv` (and the resample).

For each paper the query `<title> AND <first author's last name>` is counted with the public [Infini-gram API](https://infini-gram.io/). Run all five configurations used in the paper (each takes about 2-3 hours because of rate limiting; runs are checkpointed and can be resumed):

```bash
python 03_llm_corpus_occurrence/query_infini_gram.py --corpus olmo2     --query-format capitalize             # main result
python 03_llm_corpus_occurrence/query_infini_gram.py --corpus redpajama --query-format capitalize
python 03_llm_corpus_occurrence/query_infini_gram.py --corpus olmo2     --query-format capitalize --resample  # robustness
python 03_llm_corpus_occurrence/query_infini_gram.py --corpus olmo2     --query-format camel                  # query-format sensitivity
python 03_llm_corpus_occurrence/query_infini_gram.py --corpus redpajama --query-format camel
```

`capitalize` formats the title as "Attention is all you need"; `camel` as "Attention Is All You Need".

Then run `03_llm_corpus_occurrence/analysis_infini_gram.ipynb`, which writes per-bucket tables `citation_bucket_stats_<corpus>_<format>.csv`, correlations and scatter plots to `results/llm_corpus_occurrence/`. Finally, draw **Figure 2** (needs the Google 80th-percentile table and the OLMo2 capitalized table):

```bash
python 03_llm_corpus_occurrence/plot_prevalence_proxy_figure.py   # -> results/figures/proxy_means_by_citation_bin_log.pdf
```

## 6. Module 04: GPT-4o open-ended recall (LLM self-evaluation)

Folder: [`04_gpt4o_recall_llm_selfeval/`](04_gpt4o_recall_llm_selfeval). Input: `data/eval_set/eval_set_9108.csv`.

> This is **not** the pipeline behind the paper's main hallucination-rate results; those use the hard-coded evaluation and three LLMs and are in [PLACEHOLDER: co-author's code]. See the folder's [README](04_gpt4o_recall_llm_selfeval/README.md).

1. **Generate and self-evaluate** (2 x 9,108 OpenAI calls to `chatgpt-4o-latest`, temperature 0; about 6 hours; saved every 100 papers and resumable):
   ```bash
   python 04_gpt4o_recall_llm_selfeval/generate_and_self_evaluate.py --step all
   ```
   Outputs `results/gpt4o_recall_llm_selfeval/generated_answers.csv` and `self_evaluated_answers.csv`. The `evaluation` column holds `X, Y, Z` = matched, hallucinated, and missed authors.
2. **Analyse**: run `04_gpt4o_recall_llm_selfeval/compute_hallucination_rates.ipynb`. It computes HR1-HR5 per paper, tables per citation bin, per field x bin (with 95% confidence intervals) and per field, question-length statistics, and the OLS / mixed-effects / fractional-logit regressions.

---

## 7. Module 05: multiple-choice recognition

Folder: [`05_mc_recognition/`](05_mc_recognition). Inputs: `data/eval_set/eval_set_9108.csv` and `results/gpt4o_recall_llm_selfeval/self_evaluated_answers.csv` (module 04).

GPT-4o (temperature 0) sees the title and year of each paper with four author lists (A-D) and must pick the complete true list. Three distractor constructions are supported (`--variant`):

| Variant | Distractors | Paper |
|---|---|---|
| `original` | three random same-field author teams of the same size | main result (Section 6) |
| `same_field_swap` | the true list with one author replaced by a random same-field author | "Harder Distractor Controls" (S-F) |
| `collaborator_swap` | the true list with one non-first author replaced by a real collaborator of the first author | "Harder Distractor Controls" (Col.) |

```bash
# original (main result)
python 05_mc_recognition/build_options.py --variant original
python 05_mc_recognition/query_gpt4o.py   --variant original --dry-run   # optional: inspect prompts, no API call
python 05_mc_recognition/query_gpt4o.py   --variant original             # submit; re-run until it reports completion
python 05_mc_recognition/evaluate.py      --variant original

# same-field one-name swap (needs the original options)
python 05_mc_recognition/build_options.py --variant same_field_swap
python 05_mc_recognition/query_gpt4o.py   --variant same_field_swap
python 05_mc_recognition/evaluate.py      --variant same_field_swap

# collaborator one-name swap (needs the original options)
python 05_mc_recognition/fetch_collaborators.py          # Semantic Scholar, ~3 h without an API key
python 05_mc_recognition/build_options.py --variant collaborator_swap
python 05_mc_recognition/query_gpt4o.py   --variant collaborator_swap
python 05_mc_recognition/evaluate.py      --variant collaborator_swap

# tables and statistics reported in the paper
python 05_mc_recognition/compare_variants.py
```

`query_gpt4o.py` uses the OpenAI **Batch API** (one batch of 9,108 requests per variant, usually finished within 24 hours). It is a resumable state machine: run it once to submit, then run it again to poll and download; if some requests fail, it submits a retry batch automatically.

**Results** (in `results/mc_recognition/<variant>/`):

| File / command | Content |
|---|---|
| `options.csv` | the four options and the correct position for every paper (seed 42) |
| `responses.csv` | GPT-4o's chosen letters |
| `results.csv` | per paper: correct / incorrect, HR1-HR5, perfect recall |
| `bin_summary.csv` | per citation bin (overall, per field, single-/multi-author): raw and chance-corrected accuracy with Wilson 95% CI, recall accuracy (1 - HR), recall-recognition gap, residual recognition rate |
| `compare_variants.py` | the full-results table, the residual-recognition table, the harder-distractor table, the one-sample t-tests and Spearman correlations; saved as `results/mc_recognition/variant_comparison.csv` |
| `analysis_mc.ipynb` (set `VARIANT`) | figures in `figures/`: `fig2d_recall_recognition_gap` (main MC figure), `fig2a_overall_gap` (gap under HR1-HR5), `fig2e_perfect_recall_gap` (binary perfect recall), and further diagnostics |

## 8. Reproducibility notes

* **Random seeds.** OAG sampling uses seed 1234; MC option construction uses seed 42. The evaluation set and the proxy set are filled greedily in file order from the (randomly sampled) matched chunks, so they are deterministic given the same matched data.
* **Exact paper sets.** `01_data_collection/paper_ids_*.csv` list the papers of the evaluation set and the two proxy sets in their original row order (the order matters for the seeded MC option builder), together with the citation count and citation bin from the September 2025 Semantic Scholar snapshot used in the paper; the evaluation-set file also stores the field and the ground-truth author list. `07_fetch_datasets_from_ids.py` keeps these stored values, so every evaluation paper keeps its original bin, field and authors (Semantic Scholar revises author names over time, e.g. "S. Bree" became "S. V. van Bree"), and the seeded MC options are reproduced exactly. Author names are stored exactly as they appeared in Semantic Scholar, so a few of them (22 names in 8 papers) contain non-Latin characters. It also reports how many papers would fall into a different bin with today's counts. Titles and years, and the author lists of the proxy sets, are fetched live.
* **Semantic Scholar-dependent steps.** The collaborator pools (`fetch_collaborators.py`) are fetched live, so the `collaborator_swap` distractors will not be identical to the paper's.
* **LLM versions.** Module 04 uses the `chatgpt-4o-latest` alias and module 05 uses `gpt-4o`. Both point to model snapshots that OpenAI updates or retires over time, so newly generated answers can differ slightly from the paper even at temperature 0.
* **MC prompt.** The demonstration items are kept verbatim as used in the paper. The `original` run used a three-author second example; the two harder variants were run later with a seven-author second example (see `FEW_SHOT_BY_VARIANT` in `query_gpt4o.py`).
* **Web search.** Google hit counts depend on the live index and on BrightData's rendering, so they vary between crawls.
* **Costs.** Module 02 needs about 6,000 paid SERP requests; module 04 about 18,000 chat-completion calls; module 05 one Batch API job of 9,108 short requests per variant.
